# Overview 

Some analysis around precipitation was already completed. Since the Surf and Ice Cream shop is intending to stay open year-round, it is important to also look at the temperature data in June and December to see if this is feasible. 

# Results:

1) The average temperature in June (75 deg F) is roughly 4 degree higher than in December (71 deg F).  
2) Comparing the 25th, 50th, and 75th quartiles as well as the standard deviation, it is evident there is more variation in temperature in the month of December than there is in June. 
3) There is about 200 less datapoints in the December dataset than in the June dataset. The June dataset is therefore a little bit more reliable than the December dataset. 

# Summary:

Since there isn't much difference between the temperature in June and December, if a Surf and Ice Cream shop is successful in the summer, there is a high chance it might be successful in winter as well, if success is directly correlated to temperature alone. While temperatures may be relatively the same between the two months, the weather could be drastically different. The recommendation here is to also gather precipitation and cloudiness data for the two months as well.
